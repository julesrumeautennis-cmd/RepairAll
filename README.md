RepairALL: AI-Powered Open Source Guide for Everyday Repairs üõ†Ô∏è
RepairALL is an open-source mobile app that fights waste by making DIY repairs easy for everyone. It uses multimodal AI to turn a photo of a broken object into a visual, step-by-step repair tutorial.

The project's goal is to democratize repair knowledge, empowering users to fix what they own and promote sustainability.
